# m&m DB (Movies and Music Database)


## Description
This website allows user to find out more information about movies and song albums.

On the home page, there are two carousels, one for popular movies, and the other for popular albums. There are buttons on the left and right side of these carousels that can be used to scroll through the cards.

Once a movie or album is clicked by the user, a modal window pops up which shows the user more information about the movie/album.

A user can click the star icon on the top-right of each card to add that movie/album to their favourites list. The star icon will change accordingly. The user may repeated toggle a movie/album from their favourites list.

On the navigation bar located at the top of the webpage on all pages, there is a favourites button which when clicked, will take users to the favourites page. Here, the user can check the movies they have favourited or the albums they have favourited or both at the same time. When the page is reloaded, the items added to favourites will persist.
